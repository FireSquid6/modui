# modUI
   ModUI is a modular user interface system for Gamemaker Studio 2. It can be used to generate title screens, pause screens, and even complex inventory systems (eventually!!)
 The code is written in a single script and has modularity in mind, meaning every element has room for you to effortlessly insert custom code for animations
