# modUI
There's a lot of really good UI libraries for GM with features such as live reloading, custom scripting languages, and easy multiplatform support (One that stands out to me is [YUI](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI) by shdwcat). But a lot of these are complicated and require braincells to use, and some poeple just want to make a button that does a thing if you click on it. I rubbed my two braincells very hard together and made a mediocre UI library that allows you to do just that by inerting a method into a struct. Documentation currently in progress.
